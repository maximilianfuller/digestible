				<h1 id="title">Digestible</h1>
				<h2>Do you have a list of articles that visitors begin to read but not many finish?</h2>
				<p class="content">With Digestible, people no longer have to revisit your site to finish the collection; they simply receive the content in staggered emails and read it at their leisure. And when they've read everything, the emails stop!</p>
				<p class="content">And all you have to do to create these automated emails is paste the links to your articles. We'll do the rest!</p>
