#Digestible
With Digestible, people no longer have to revisit an archive of articles to finish it; they simply receive each article every few days within an email to read at their leisure. And when they've read everything, the emails stop!

##HOW IT WORKS: 
**A writer creates a subscription form.**
Here readers sign up to receive each article as an email. 

**The writer makes the scheduled emails.**
They paste the URL of each article and we generate the subject lines and conten. Or the writer creates the email from scratch.  

**The writer links to their subscription form under their article collection.**
Now their readers have the option to casually read the articles with periodic emails.

##HOW TO RUN IT
The database must first be initialized by running the following line of code:
node loader.js

Additionally, npm dependencies must be installed by running the following line of code:
npm install.

To run digestible on http://localhost:8080, execute the following line of code:
node server.js.
