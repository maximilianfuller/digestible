		<!--We can start off by making this landing page very simple. Black and white with some nice fonts, like the blogging tutorial I emailed out. This way, our mobile version will just be a more narrow version of our landing page. -->
		<h1>Digestible</h1>
		<h2>Do you have a list of articles that visitors begin to read but not many finish?</h2>
		<h3>With Digestible, people no longer have to revisit your site to finish the collection; they simply receive the content in staggered emails and read it at their leisure. And when they've read everything, the emails stop!</h3>
		<h3>And all you have to do to create these automated emails is paste the links to your articles. We'll do the rest!</h3>

		<h2>Here's how Digestible works.</h2>
		<!--We can add photos under each step to illuminate the process later on. -->
		<ol>
			<li>Sign up.</li> <!--Let's add another link to sign up here. -->
			<li>To create a subscription form, describe your collection of articles, and we'll provide you a link.</li>
			<li>To create the scheduled emails, paste the URLs of the articles, and we'll generate the subject lines and content for you, or you can make the emails from scratch. Regardless, you can always edit them.</li>
			<li>So readers can enjoy your content in the form of periodic emails, put the link to your subscription form under your archive.</li>
			<li>That's it!</li>
